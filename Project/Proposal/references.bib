abstract = {X-ray micro-CT is gaining importance among paleontologists for studying fossil remains. In micro-CT, a 3D representation of the specimen is calculated from a series of X-ray transmission images recorded from different angles. It is a non-destructive technique that requires little or no sample preparation. Micro-CT proves to be especially suited for studying fossil inclusions in amber, the fossilized resin of trees. Yet only few applications have been described in literature. A number of specimens were therefore scanned at the new ultra-high-resolution tomography facility of the Ghent University (Belgium). This facility offers spatial resolutions down to the micrometer level. We show that a wealth of taxonomical detail can be preserved in amber, often enough for a detailed description and classification down to a species level, even for specimens smaller than 1 mm. Micro-CT can also reveal features that are invisible using the standard optical techniques due to for example, air bubbles, other inclusions or opacity of the amber itself. Even internal structures inside the specimen can be revealed. This implies that micro-CT can become an important tool for paleontologists. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper provides a brief but comprehensive guide to creating, preparing and dissecting a ‘virtual' fossil, using a worked example to demonstrate some standard data processing techniques. Computed tomography (CT) is a 3D imaging modality for producing ‘virtual' models of an object on a computer. In the last decade, CT technology has greatly improved, allowing bigger and denser objects to be scanned increasingly rapidly. The technique has now reached a stage where systems can facilitate large-scale, non-destructive comparative studies of extinct fossils and their living relatives. Consequently the main limiting factor in CT-based analyses is no longer scanning, but the hurdles of data processing (see disclaimer). The latter comprises the techniques required to convert a 3D CT volume (stack of digital slices) into a virtual image of the fossil that can be prepared (separated) from the matrix and ‘dissected' into its anatomical parts. This technique can be applied to specimens or part of specimens embedded in the rock matrix that until now have been otherwise impossible to visualise. This paper presents a suggested workflow explaining the steps required, using as example a fossil tooth of Sphenacanthus hybodoides (Egerton), a shark from the Late Carboniferous of England. The original NHMUK copyrighted CT slice stack can be downloaded for practice of the described techniques, which include segmentation, rendering, movie animation, stereo-anaglyphy, data storage and dissemination. Fragile, rare specimens and type materials in university and museum collections can therefore be virtually processed for a variety of purposes, including virtual loans, website illustrations, publications and digital collections. Micro-CT and other 3D imaging techniques are increasingly utilized to facilitate data sharing among scientists and on education and outreach projects. Hence there is the potential to usher in a new era of global scientific collaboration and public communication using specimens in museum collections.},

    abstract = { ▪ Abstract Image segmentation plays a crucial role in many medical-imaging applications, by automating or facilitating the delineation of anatomical structures and other regions of interest. We present a critical appraisal of the current status of semiautomated and automated methods for the segmentation of anatomical medical images. Terminology and important issues in image segmentation are first presented. Current segmentation approaches are then reviewed with an emphasis on the advantages and disadvantages of these methods for medical imaging applications. We conclude with a discussion on the future of image segmentation methods in biomedical research. }

We provide a list of successful areas of applications in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Image Processing, Robotics and Automation.

The system was designed as the central component of a fully-automated phenotyping system. The system contains three modules (1) a convolutional network trained to classify each pixel into five categories: cell wall, cytoplasm, nucleus membrane, nucleus, outside medium; (2) an Energy-Based Model which cleans up the output of the convolutional network by learning local consistency constraints that must be satisfied by label images; (3) A set of elastic models of the embryo at various stages of development that are matched to the label images.},
